General Approach
Started off by plotting out the structure for the backend. I knew from the start that I would need a user model.  

Challenges
Encountered a factoryManager bean error that would not allow my microservices to build. I was also was having issues with the JWToken files and my userRepository. Turns out it was one of my property settings. Once I adjusted and added the correct properties in my properties file, it was able to run the build in microservices. That error set me back a day while working on my back-end. 

Additionally, incorporating JWTokens into react was also a challenge. That’s something I haven’t done before.
