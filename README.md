## General Approach
Started off by plotting out the structure for the backend. I knew from the start that I would need a user model. After that started my front-end, focusing on the visual aspect and then focused making the JWToken stuff work. After all of the backend stuff was done I focused on the frontend.

## Challenges
Encountered a factoryManager bean error that would not allow my microservices to build. I was also was having issues with the JWToken files and my userRepository. Turns out it was one of my property settings. Once I adjusted and added the correct properties in my properties file, it was able to run the build in microservices. That error set me back a day while working on my backend.


## User Stories
our users are regular everyday people who go grocery shopping.

* As a User, I want an a grocery list app so that I can add all my  items and remove them once I have those items in my shopping cart.
* As a user, I want the ability to be able to log in if I want to.
* As a User, I want an app that I can use before I go grocery shopping where I can save items.
